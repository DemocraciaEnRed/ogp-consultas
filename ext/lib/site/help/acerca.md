# About this site

Digital Consultations is an open source platform, easy to install and customizable, which encourages participation, debate and interaction between entities and individuals on various topics. Its versatility allows its use by both government agencies and civil society entities.

This tool was designed by Democracia en Red, an Argentine organization founded in 2014 with the aim of creating solutions for citizen participation with governments and activists to strengthen democracy. Digital Consultations seeks to be part of a process of openness in public institutions and decision-making processes to recover politics based on diagnoses that point to action. In this sense, the tool allows the participation of citizens to debate, be informed and vote on different issues.
